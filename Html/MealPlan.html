        Looking for a healthy weekly meal plan? Here’s a 28 day healthy meal
        plan with recipes for healthy meals throughout the week.
      </p>
      <p id="mealPlanContent">
        Are you overwhelmed by what healthy food to cook but don’t know where to
        start? Alex and I were there when we first got married! But over the
        last 10 plus years, we’ve invested a huge amount of time and energy into
        a system of eating healthy meals that actually works. Since then, we’ve
        become authors of the cookbook Pretty Simple Cooking, named one of the
        best healthy cookbooks of 2018 and best vegetarian cookbooks. We’ve
        cooked everywhere from our home kitchen to the TODAY Show with the
        message that healthy eating can be “pretty simple.” Healthy eating is
        more than just making a recipe here and there: it’s finding a
        sustainable practice of healthy meals in the long term. The goal of this
        healthy weekly meal plan is to help you find a handful of favorite
        healthy recipes that you can make again and again! If you’d like,
        subscribe to our newsletter for new weekly recipes.

      <p id="mealPlanIntroduction">The problem with meal planning calendars</p>
      <p id="mealPlanContent">
        For Alex and me, the problem with meal planning calendars and healthy
        weekly meal plans is that they offer no flexibility. Most meal plans
        we’ve found call for cooking something new every day of the week.
        They’re overwhelming with the amount of food prep that they call for!
        They also don’t account for your schedule: what if Monday nights I have
        a weekly meeting where I eat dinner? Or this Friday night I’m going out
        with friends? Here’s what makes our healthy meal plan different:
        Spotlight dinner ideas. For us, dinner is our main meal where we cook
        and get the majority of our nutrients for the day. Our approach is to go
        big on dinner, and then do super simple things for breakfast and lunch.
        That’s what works for us! At the bottom of the meal plan you’ll find
        lists of healthy breakfast ideas, snack ideas, and lunch ideas. You can
        use these, or find others that fit your tastes. Pick 3. Each week, we
        offer 3 healthy meals for dinner. You can make them on any day that
        week! This encourages you to customize the ideas based on your schedule
        and particular tastes. It also encourages eating up leftovers. Repeats.
        Since we only offer 3 dinner ideas, this also encourages you to make
        dinner ideas you liked from previous weeks.

        What if this meal plan doesn’t work for me?
      </p>
      <p id="mealPlanContent">
        It’s possible this healthy weekly meal plan might not work for you–and
        that’s ok! This meal plan might provide too much flexibility for you and
        not motivate you to make the recipes. Or, you might not like the style
        of these recipes. (If you eat a vegetarian or vegan diet, you’ll want to
        use our 28 Day Vegetarian Meal Plan and 28 Day Vegan Meal Plan). We know
        healthy meal plans are not for everyone, but this is an outline of how
        Alex and I cook on a weekly basis.
