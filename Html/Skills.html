        Making homemade salad dressing is one of the first things Alex and I
        learned as new cooks, and we were fascinated. Nothing but a little olive
        oil and vinegar, and we could have dressing for days. Plus, we could
        avoid random preservatives and additives AND get rid of the
        centuries-old crusty bottles of ranch in our refrigerator. Sold! Keep
        reading for our best salad dressing recipe.When I first starting making
        homemade salad dressing, I made the mistake of lessening the amount of
        oil. Since then I’ve corrected my ways, because the oil is needed to
        correctly make the emulsion: that creamy, magical combination of vinegar
        suspended in oil. I’ve reworked our basic vinaigrette recipe (below) to
        reflect this, and made a few more changes to make it even simpler.
        Because salad dressing should be just that: simple. This one requires no
        mincing of garlic or shallot, just combine olive oil, vinegar, mustard,
        and a little honey, and whisk away. Homemade salad dressing is easily
        customizable to your own tastes. A few dressing tips: Use a 3 to 1 ratio
        of oil versus vinegar For the acid, you can substitute balsamic, red
        wine, apple cider, or sherry vinegar, OR lemon, lime, or orange juice
        (play with quantities to taste) Feel free to add in chopped herbs,
        minced garlic, minced shallot, fancy salts, you name it Store in a glass
        jar with a tight lid in the refrigerator; bring to room temperature and
        stir before serving. (This dressing is likely shelf stable but we keep
        it in the refrigerator just in case.) On the topic of homemade salad
        dressing, our latest A Couple Cooks Podcast episode is all about it!
        Plus, it includes a sweet giveaway of 3 bottles of California Olive
        Ranch olive oil — see the podcast page for details.
