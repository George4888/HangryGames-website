      <p id="secondContentAbout">
        George & Ioana & Marian & Mia are writer and photographer of the award
        winning food blog A Couple Cooks, and authors of the book Pretty Simple
        Cooking, named a best vegetarian cookbook by Epicurious and Food & Wine.
        The couple has a worldwide following for their vegetarian and plant
        based recipes. They are authors of a series with Washington Post Food
        called Voraciously: Plant Powered, a recipe newsletter on how to cook
        more plant-forward meals. A Couple Cooks won IACP Best Individual Blog
        award in 2019 by the International Association of Culinary
        Professionals, a professional association co-founded by Julia Child.
        Their original recipes are inspired by seasonal produce and their
        adventures travelling the globe: expect everything from cauliflower
        tacos to margherita pizza.
